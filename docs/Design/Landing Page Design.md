## Goals

1. Communicate quality and craft
2. Move users from inspiration to contact with minimal friction
3. Keep copy light and let imagery lead (less text, stronger visuals)

## Page Flow/ Wireframe

### Header

### Hero (Full bleed)

Set tone and confidence with one strong image and minimal words.

3. Short supporting line (Each project responds to climate, context, and how the space will be used.)
4. Primary CTA (Get a Free Site Visit)
5. Micro trust line (We listen first • 20+ years of experience • Details matter)

### Value Strip (3 cards, horizontal scroll)

Lowkey just an excuse to allow CTA to pop and shine.
